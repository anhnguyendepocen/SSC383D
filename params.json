It is intended for Ph.D students in statistics, but also suitable for graduate students in other disciplines with (1) substantial previous statistical training, and (2) an interest in designing bespoke statistical methods for their own data sets.\r\n\r\nWe will focus on statistical inference arising from formal probability models.  The course is taught primarily, although not exclusively, from a Bayesian perspective.  Major topics to be covered include: theory of the multivariate normal distribution; mixture models and other latent-variable models; density estimation; hierarchical models; generalized linear models; and ``non-iid'' models incorporating, for example, spatial or temporal dependence.  Examples will be taken from across the social, biological, and physical sciences.\r\n\r\n### Week 1\r\n\r\n","google":"","name":"SSC 383D"}
